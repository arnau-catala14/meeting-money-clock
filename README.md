**MeetingBurner** is a passive-aggressive productivity tool designed to visualize the real-time financial cost of corporate meetings. By inputting the number of attendees and their average hourly rate, the app displays a high-contrast, anxiety-inducing ticker showing exactly how much company money is evaporating second by second.

- **📊 Dynamic Equivalence Engine:** Instead of just numbers, see what you're losing in real-world terms.
